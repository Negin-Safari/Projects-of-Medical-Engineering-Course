# Projects-of-Medical-Engineering-Course
This part is consisted of two projects that are done using Matlab:

The first project is about REM sleep. In this, I have analyzed various stages of sleep by studying collected datasets. By taking advantage of Power Spectrum Density of the given time-based data, this analysis is completed. The last part of the project is to guess the stage of two given datasets, by comparing their frequency features with known datasets. Here you can find these two unknown datasets that are plotted based on different bandwidth, along with the guessed stage number.

The second project is about classification of bio-based datasets using machine learning methods. In this project the first dataset contains heartbeat sound of people with the labels of normal and abnormal, and the second dataset which is selected by me from "Index of /ml/machine-learning-databases/adult (uci.edu)" contains 15 features of people to dedicate the fact that their weight is above 50 kg or lower than that. The machine learning methods in here are Tree, KNN, Linear SVM, Quadratic SVM, Logistic Regression, and Ensemble. The first dataset had the best accuracy in classification using KNN, and the second dataset had the best accuracy using Ensemble; and the results can be seen in the following diagrams.
